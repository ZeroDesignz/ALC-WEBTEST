    //   1954 A legend is born in italy.

    //   -1993 Dr. Micalgo receives a G√∂del Prize for his outstanding work in Computer Science. He is passionate about pioneering the world of finance to remove inefficiency, existing corruption, and inequality.

    //   -2008 Legend has it that Satoshio Nakamalgo sets on a path to become a Superhero. So he mints the world's first Bithero and disappears into the Algoverse. At first Bithero means well but is ridiculed, rejected, and disregarded by the masses as worthless and so it hurts his ego. But just as the world rejects him, some embrace him as their hero!

    //   Overtime he gains control and power planting mining rigs all over the Earth üåé. As his power grows so does his corruption. Inequality begins to reign, pollution causes devastating climate impacts and the evil forces that once ruled the planet are now in control of BitHeros powers. All the while his gangs are building mass rigs and spilling toxic gasses into the atmosphere in order to take over the Blockworld.
    //   His true identity is unknown. The masses till this day wonder who the real Satoshio Nakamalgo is.

    //   2010 By the turn of the new decade, Dr. Micalgo is one of many scientific minds who have seen the destruction that Satoshio  and his creation ‚ÄúBithero‚Äù have wrought. The more data that piles in on the ledger the more clear it becomes that the physical world is in danger and quickly running out of time. Micalgo realises that this is why so many heroes and villains, master minds and schemers all jump into the algoverse‚Ä¶to survive the coming catastrophe.

    //   Without hesitation, Micalgo begins his search for a solution.

    //   -2012 Nobel Prize awarded to Dr. Micalgo by the Association for Computing Machinery for contributions "of lasting and major technical importance to the computer field‚Äù Dr. Micalgo begins to devise a plan to defend the block world from inefficiencies and bitheros corrupt dominance. Though only in the beginning stages, Dr. Micalgo speaks of an ultimate ‚Äúhero‚Äù, an entity that can traverse both the metaverse and the physical universe without hindrance. The doctor spoke of his powers and potential to restore balance and justice to the algoverse and to the rest of the world.

    //   -2013-2014 Etherio Vitalgo sets on a path to take over BitHeroes reign over the world and ignites his gas fee gangs, adding to the already smoggy atmosphere.

    //   -LiteHero and a bunch of others pop up but the world has lost faith in block game technology and they fail to restore balance.

    //   Major news outlets are reporting to the masses that this technology is not safe, it is corrupt and harmful so the general public remains apathetic to the overtaking of the Blockworld. Millions of people rush to social media to debate the uses and dangers of the technology. Some claim this whole thing was a scam that started way at the beginning with Satoshio o and his schemes. Some proudly say they believe in this world, and that this is the only, inevitable future.

    //   2017 Dr. Micalgo is recognized yet again for his outstanding contribution to computer science.

    //   2019 Algoman is minted by Dr. Micalgo. He is the resolution to the blockgame trilemma but he doesn't yet have the adoption and support that he needs to overpower the existing Blockgangs.

    //   Algoman is young, but itching to get into the action and start making a change for the better. Against the wishes of Dr. Micalgo, he trains and fights local blockgangs before suiting up and embarking on a mission that will take him out of the walls of his home.

    //   Algoman leaves the VIP Hall of Algo and warps into a portal arriving at The Etherio Gangs Gas Palace. When he arrives he is ambushed by Etherios goons. A battle ensues and Algoman manages to escape just before being overtaken.

    //   Upon Algomans arrival Dr. Micalgo Sets out a stress signal to the Algoverse calling all Heroes to gather in the VIP Hall of Algo. He believes he can save the block world from the existing plethora of gas fee miner gangs by assembling AlgoLeagues - a collective of Superheroes with a variety of different strengths.

    //   2020 Dr. Micalgo begins to build partnerships with other Leagues of heroes in the Algoverse. After Etherio found a way to upgrade his powers in response to Algomans battle and is now Etherio2.0! (upgrade window)

    //   Scores of heroes jump into action to do their part in making the world a safer place for all but it may be too late as there are now scores of super villains on the scene.

    //   2021 Deciphalgo Happens and block heroes and legends begin to sense a calling to: (TBD)

    //   2022- The AlgoLeagues Genesis VIPs have gathered and are ready to begin their quest to solve the blockworld trilemma. Building partnerships, adding Catalysts, and staking in the Block battlegrounds is the only real way to gain mass adoption and support for AlgoLeagues development.

    //   New heroes and villains arrive, showing an array of different powers and technologies never before seen.

    //   Minted in 2019 by Dr. Micalgo, this hero is the culmination of years of scientific research and discovery. Algoman was designed with the capacity to warp through time and space with little to no effort, as well as fight off all incoming threats in the metaverse, especially Bithero and Etherio.

    //   Though he looks like a grown man, and his celestial blue suit is designed to give him an imposing look, Algoman is a very young soul, and his powers are not fully developed. This became very apparent when our hero warped right into Etherios gas palace to fight what is currently the most powerful blockgang out there - the Etherio gang. Algoman put up a hell of a fight, and got much further than Litehero and other predecessors, but the Etherio gang eventually overwhelmed Algoman on the fifth floor of the giant gas palace. Algoman was launched out of the giant glass window and just managed to survive and live to fight another day.

    //   Dr. Micalgo hopes that with enough time and support, the power and faith of the people he is trying to save will fuel Algoman‚Äôs powers, and he will surge to meet the rising threats: Not only are more and more copycats coming out from both sides, but the mainstream adoration of Bithero and Etherio have induced them with near supernatural power. To make things worse, Etherio has recently upgraded his layer 1 and layer 2 capabilities, unlocking an array of new abilities and skills, and making him one thousand times more dangerous than he was before. Some say Etherio now is as powerful as Bithero in his prime. Though only time and deeds will tell if this is true.

    //   If Algoman has any hope of defeating the Etherio gang and their leader now, he needs to power up and ally with heroes from all over the metaverse to form the Algoleagues, and finally put an end to all the misery the blockchain trilemma has brought about.

At first, he did. But soon his corruption grew along with his power, and the world began to be covered in clouds of grey sut and polluting chemicals that spread and damaged all life.

    //   Despite all the damage, pollution and inefficiencies that Bithero brought to the world, he gained legions of fans and introduced the people to the blockworld. Millions of people quickly became acquainted with their superior technology and intelligence. Block Gangs and crypto-heros became a point of contention in the mainstream media, and as the world watched, Bithero became a giant, so large and so menacing he no longer had need of fighting with small one-timers in order to gain control. Even the greatest heroes have no choice but to be grateful and acknowledge the real good that Bithero did in his glory days. If it wasn‚Äôt for him, Algoman and his allies wouldn't be able to keep growing in power as more and more people fueled their strength. Bithero is the architect of all that came after, which is what makes him and Satoshio  such terrifying menaces.

    //   At one point, before Algoman was even created, Bithero split into two entities. One, was a regular size being that used his powers to lead the underground bitmarket and consolidate gang influence. The other incorporeal half now lives in the Algoverse, sitting on a throne of gold, watching the chaos ensue all around him. Not even heroes like Algoman knows this half exists, thus none know that killing his smaller half won't put an end to the rule of Bithero‚Ä¶ in all honesty, very few things could ever put an end to it.

In what seems like an insignificant amount of time, Etherio rose from being another generic blockgang leader, to being the principal warlord in the algoverse. His reach expands through every corner of the greater metaverse and he has legions of followers in the physical realm too. The closest he has ever been to being defeated was when a young hero named Algoman besieged his great palace and almost reached his top floor chamber. Luckily, the threat was neutralised, and he had a chance to recover before more heroes came knocking.

    //   Etherio is as much of a scientist as he is a cunning warrior, and for all his might on the battlefield, the real danger he brings to the algoverse happens behind closed doors. Unlike Bithero, Etherio is constantly thirsty for improvements and new secrets. He is never satisfied within his current form, and will go to any lengths in order to improve, regardless of who he hurts. It would be impossible to count how many small members of the Algo Leagues he has beaten down just to extract their technology and absorb their powers.

    //   Currently, Etherio is in the process of upgrading into Etherio 2.0, and will be one thousand times more powerful than he was before. He is the first crytpovillain to gain knwoledge of Bithero‚Äôs second half, and is also now strong enough to warp through time and space just like Algoman.

    //   Though he is incredibly powerful, he is not invincible, and Etherio knows this. Every day he sends his goons to attack and distract Dr. Micalgo and his friends, hoping to weaken them and slow them down until Etherio becomes too powerful to deal with. Only time will tell who wins in the end

She doesn‚Äôt have much time, so she quickly locates him, or rather his consciousness, while Keli extracts Dr. Micalgo‚Äôs body on Earth. It‚Äôs a success‚Ä¶maybe too easy of a success‚Ä¶
          Back in the lab, Sofi and Keli get Dr. Micalgo to wake up by putting him into the Upgrade Chamber. The chamber infuses his body with nutrients and a shock. The moment he awakes, ‚Äúwhere is Al?‚Äù Sofi and Keli gesture to Al‚Äôs body. Al is still in a coma. He rushes over to Al, who is still unconscious. He stares at his son a moment, thinking.`,

          ‚ÄúGet back and stop touching him,‚Äù as she hooks Al up to another part of the Chamber, and she plugs herself in too. They all wait and nothing. Nothing happens. Sofi, defeated, goes to unplug herself, and a blinding white light is released. It knocks Sofi back, and all that is heard are the distorted sounds of Al yelling. It‚Äôs almost digital sounding. Sofi collapses, and Al has disappeared.
          BITHERO Class: Villain
          Special Skill(s): Unknown
          Last Seen: He exists everywhere‚Ä¶
          Bio: Bithero is the architect of all that came after; known as ‚Äúthe great ancient‚Äù or ‚Äúfallen angel‚Äù by other blockgangs throughout the metaverse. Bithero was the first crypto hero created by Satoshio Nakamalgo, in hopes of making the world a better place. At first, he did. He gained legions of fans and introduced the people to the blockworld. Millions of people quickly became acquainted with their superior technology and intelligence. However, corruption grew along with his power, and soon Bithero became a giant. So large and menacing that he no longer had need to fight with small one-timers to gain control. But - even the greatest heroes have no choice but to be grateful and acknowledge the real good that Bithero did in his glory days. If it wasn‚Äôt for him, Algoman and his allies wouldn't be able to keep growing in power.

          Breaking News Potentially Lethal Attack at The Gas Palace: Screams Heard, Falling Man, Shattered Glass.
          Aired February 08, 2019 - 04:00  ET
          [04:00:11] KIZLA NUANDU, AHDL CORRESPONDENT: Hello, I'm Kizla Nuandu. I want to welcome everyone from all metaverses and around the world. We have breaking news.
          Currently we are following details of a potentially lethal attack at Etherio‚Äôs Gas Palace. Screams have been heard and shattered glass, along with the usual slight green haze, surrounds the grounds of the tower. This is the home of Etherio and a frequent hangout spot of Bithero. Local officials, S.W.A.T. teams, and other members of the Etherio blockchain are all on the scene. This is all coming to us from our local affiliate who is also on the scene.
          It seems to have happened around three thirty am. At this moment, we have a report of a potential death. More information comes moment by moment.
          From what we understand, this may be connected to the recent explosion at the Nobel Prize ceremony, where Etherio rushed to the scene to help injured individuals. Again, at this time, it is unknown who is involved.
          Hie Park is on the scene live.
          Hie, what have you learned?
          HIE PARK, AHDL SENIOR METAVERSE CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Kizla. This is still a moment to moment situation. As you explained, reports of screaming and seeing a man fall from a few stories has the entire surrounding community shaken to their core. This is NOT the kind of activity and environment these people are used to. It‚Äôs a complex situation.
          One man reported seeing a figure, surrounded by shattered glass, wheezing for air.
          NUANDU: That is a startling report Hie.
          PARK: It certainly was difficult to hear the fear in the man‚Äôs voice. The local officials are looking for individuals who are said to have come to the scene after the man fell. Currently, there is no sign of the rumored assailants.
          NUANDU: Harrowing. All stay tuned for further updates. Try to be safe out there. But we may need Bithero and Etherio to protect us‚Ä¶.

Yes, she is on the lookout for Algoman. ‚ÄúWait, I think I hear something. I‚Äôll put you all on standby as I investigate.‚Äù As Keli gets closer sounds of a tussle are heard.
          Algoman throws a punch as he teleports underneath the man to kick him from below. This sends the man flying into the air. ‚ÄúAh! Please stop!‚Äù Yells the man that is being attacked by Algoman. Yes, attacked. 
          From afar, Keli sees the man flailing, mid-air, from Algoman‚Äôs attack. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve found him. Sending a signal now,‚Äù she sprints toward them both as she opens her mouth to release a beautiful high pitch tone. The man falls to the ground, still tranced, by Keli‚Äôs sound. Algoman is stuck in place but is visibly struggling to move. Keli holds her tone long enough for Dr. Micalgo and Sofi to get to the scene. As Dr. Micalgo approaches, he too is frozen by Keli, so Sofi rushes over to Algoman and places a device on him that dampers his ability to teleport.

          ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt funny Al. It‚Äôs true we know you can teleport, but we don‚Äôt yet know your limitations,‚Äù explains Sofi.

          Al scoffs, and after a moment asks, ‚Äúit‚Äôs been a week, and it seems you all couldn‚Äôt be any less concerned about getting back at Etherio. I‚Äôm the only one doing anything. We finally have this opportunity‚ÄîME! To do something and all you want to do is run tests.‚Äù
          Dr. Micalgo rushes inside the chamber. ‚ÄúPLEASE! Please Al, just stop‚Ä¶I‚Äîwe will continue to run tests. I know for you it‚Äôs been a week, but for me, I last saw my son rushing towards me during an explosion. I saw you lifeless as this huge thing grabbed me, and I thought it was over for us both. Then, when I do get back to you, you were in a coma for months, with no hope in sight. I took a hail Mary, a chance that ended your life. My son‚Äôs life. You died Al. Yes, you came back and, yes it‚Äôs been a week. But it‚Äôs like you have been trying to get yourself destroyed EVERYDAY in the ONE WEEK, that you have been‚ÄîAlgoman!‚Äù Dr. Micalgo is on the verge of tears. ‚ÄúAl, I‚Äôm doing the best I can to keep my son alive.‚Äù Silence falls for a while.

          It‚Äôs quiet. Al is completely alone. Still restrained, he replays the exchange he had with his father, the last fights he‚Äôs had with criminals and block gang members and thinks about how everything is Etherio‚Äôs fault. He‚Äôs getting angrier and angrier, as tears begin to fall down his face. Something strange begins to happen. The more he focuses on Etherio, he can see him. As in he can see where he is. The scene is becoming clearer, Etherio is currently at his Gas Palace‚Ä¶ talking to a tired Bithero‚Ä¶on the top floor. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be much security or rather not much security that can stop Algoman.  As Al‚Äôs anger comes to a climax, he finds himself right inside of The Gas Palace.

Al, still fuming, goes up to the second floor, where he encounters 3 of Etherio‚Äôs goons. They rush him, but not before they set off a blaring alarm. Al uses his teleportation skills during battle, and the 3 goons are toast. Al quickly moves through them, to the fourth floor. By this time, Etherio and Bithero, who are on the top floor, have been notified of Algoman‚Äôs breach. Bithero is unmotivated until details of the intruder begin to roll in.`,

It looks as if someone is hovering over him. He wrestles to stay alert, but he loses the battle and passes out because of internal injuries.

He recruited a core team of Sofi and Keli to build his lab from the ground up. With their help, he pioneered coding and technology to promote what other blockchains had failed to execute properly: scalability, security, and decentralization. This would become the technological foundation used to create The Upgrade Chamber and Catalysts. Without this coding our first hero, Algoman, would not have been minted.

          ‚ÄòWhy am I an explorer? Well, before I began going on expeditions and other adventures, I used to pick two spots, per year, to go on solo sail adventures. I started doing this around twenty one. It was 1903, and I had been doing this thing for about three years, so I was comfortable. After having traveled to Japan, I thought, this time I should sail off the coast from Hokkaido. So I did. I wanted to try something different. I was nervous about finding my resources and getting all the equipment because I didn‚Äôt know how to speak Japanese. But, that‚Äôs part of the challenge, to thrust yourself into the unknown.
          It took me about two weeks to get everything for the sail: food, water, emergency materials, any and everything one could need just in case. When you‚Äôre out there, it‚Äôs just you and the mighty waters. Right at daybreak is when I set sail. It was a nice day, shining sun, cool breeze, just easy. So calm, the waves rocked my boat and put me to sleep. I had studied the wind, water, and weather patterns over this area for a few months, and I was sure it‚Äôd be an easy sail‚Ä¶.however, I must‚Äôve got something wrong because I was startled awake as my boat thrashed against the waves. I was in the middle of a heavy rain storm, filled with lightning and thunder. There was complete darkness besides the flashes of light. The moonlight was hidden behind heavy clouds of rain, and the wind, waves and thunder were so strong and loud. I was pretty scared. I scrambled to get ahold of the anchor for some stability and grabbed the tiller, but my small boat wasn‚Äôt designed for these waters or storms. There was a flash of thunder, and all I caught was a glimpse of a wall of water rising, that looked to be as tall as the sky. At that sight I made my peace with The Creator, and accepted what I thought was the end. To this day, I don‚Äôt remember much after that moment.
          I came-to, on an island. I don‚Äôt know how long it has been since my last moment. No boat in sight, just me, washed ashore. I was awakened by two cute little dogs licking my face. I got excited because I thought there would be people there, but it was truly an island of dogs. I had heard the folklore of Cerber Island, but it was just that to me‚Äîfolklore. In the beginning, the dogs kept me great company. I spent most days focused on building a raft, eating‚Äîbananas that I found the dogs eating, or hunting for fish. The nights, I was comforted by the pups and some dogs that seemed to enjoy my company too. It was nice. After about five days, I felt good about my raft. I wanted to take the two pups I‚Äôd grown attached to, so I prepared for us and felt I had enough provisions to take my chances on the sea again. That night I went to sleep, with my mind set to sail in the morning when the seas are usually calmest.
          Before dawn, I was awakened by the two little pups. They guided me deeper into the forest‚Ä¶after what seemed like a ten minute journey, we came upon the dogs of the island. But not how we think of them, the dogs were moving around in an organized manner. These dogs had tan to orange colored fur, with a few brown ones, all medium sized, and all focused on their task at hand. They were bringing in materials like wood, fish, and any shiny objects they found, to form four circles. Three smaller ones with a large one in the center. I had never seen this sort of highly organized, ritualistic behavior from dogs. I think the pups had grown to trust me and wanted to show me where‚Ä¶they‚Äôre from? I‚Äôm not sure. Soon I began to hear‚Ä¶howling in different pitches. I stared in awe, as some dogs hopped up on their hind legs, and others moved‚Ä¶while thrashing about. From the jungle, three separate, small groups of two dogs each, guided one dog, totaling three, to each one of the three smaller circles. I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was seeing.
          These three dogs appeared to be covered in mud. As the three entered their respective circles, they began growling ferociously at each other while the dogs around them grew more intense with their actions and noises. The two pups were clinging to me‚Ä¶maybe it was their first ritual? Maybe I had reason to be afraid too‚Ä¶ Then silence fell over them all for about one minute. Next, the dogs on the outside of the circles released a unified bark, as the three in the center charged towards one another. I‚Äôll never forget, there was a loud clap, accompanied by blinding light, and before us all stood The Cerberus of legends.
          It was a core shaking vision. This massive, snarling, three headed beast, was barking and thrashing everywhere. The small dogs seemed to do the strangest thing of offering themselves to it. The moment I saw the beast go to eat the smaller dogs, I picked up the two pups and took off running through the forest. As I ran, all I could think was that I needed to get away, fast. I reached my raft, and could still hear the sounds of Cerberus from afar. I packed up as fast as I could, grabbed the pups, and set sail. The seas were calm, and within, what felt like one hour, I could see land. As I grew closer, it looked too familiar. It was Hokkaido. I was confused. It wasn‚Äôt possible. I was not that close this whole time. I told the locals what happened and they began to nickname me ‚Äúcerber man,‚Äù and no one believed my claims. Besides the dogs, I had no proof other than my word that this ever happened. However, from this, I knew I wanted to become an explorer. I spent much of my career trying to find that island again, but never had any luck.‚Äô
          As Al closes the book he says to himself, ‚Äúhuh, that‚Äôs pretty cool. I‚Äôm going to present this to the FutureFi board for Earth Day!‚Äù He continues, while being super excited, ‚Äúyo, Kelz, Sof! I‚Äôve been doing some research of my own on the dog situation, and wanted to put you on to this aIpha I just found‚Äî.‚Äù

          ‚ÄúWe cataloged that a week ago, but love your enthusiasm‚Äù teases Sofi.
          The ladies walk off, leaving Al a tad dumbfounded. He shouts after them, ‚Äúawww c‚Äômon guys, you ladies are always leaving me out. Do you already have your presentations set for the Earth Day Initiative? Sof!‚Äù Al receives no response, and says ‚Äúnot cool,‚Äù as he teleports to catch up to them.

Meanwhile, inside Etherio‚Äôs Tower, in one of his many rooms, another meeting takes place later that night. There are many figures, all shrouded and sitting in dim lighting, dressed in Black Tie attire, with masks. The shadows, masks, and clothing, shield their individual identities.

Everyone has code names in this meeting. All that is clear, is that these attendees are committed to the vision established by Etherio.
          ‚ÄúIt seems the so-called Captain Watch is gaining strides in his efforts to reduce gas fees.‚Äù The voice, identical sounding to the main speaker, continues, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wondering what can be done to‚Ä¶ensure we maintain our vision regarding earnings.‚Äù

        People are screaming and running away as Al pushes Etherio into a nearby building. ‚ÄúAhhhh, that‚Äôs it‚Äù yells Etherio out of frustration from battling the swift Algoman. ‚ÄúGet out!‚Äù Etherio screams out to the public as he releases the thickest and most toxic gas he has ever released. Al thought he didn‚Äôt need to avoid this gas but did not know that just as he has grown, so has Etherio. Al teleports into the midst of the fog and lands a punch to Etherio‚Äôs ankle that causes Etherio to fall. As Al breathes, he begins to feel disoriented. He tries to teleport and discovers he can‚Äôt. Panic settles in when Al realizes he is being poisoned. Al sends a message to Sofi, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt enter gas.‚Äù
        ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my new recipe, do you like it?‚Äù Questions Etherio as he sits up and swats Al with the back of his hand. Al flies up in the air, and as he falls, Etherio lands another punch that send Al right into a tree. Etherio walks over, tears the tree out of the ground with Al still in its branches and submerges it in water for one minute. When he pulls the tree out of the water, he picks Al out of it‚Äôs branches and throws his body onto concrete. As Al lays motionless, Etherio walks over to crush Algoman with his foot, the final blow. Etherio picks up his foot, and as it comes down upon Algoman, Etherio pulls back his foot, ‚Äúowwww.‚Äù
        AlgoBot has encased Algoman for his protection and begins fighting Etherium. ‚ÄúYou made it. I knew you would. Thanks.‚Äù
        ‚ÄúAlgoBot is always happy to protect his friends,‚Äù replies AlgoBot as he jumps up and punches Etherio. ‚ÄúThere are high levels of arson, carbon monoxide, and other poisonous elements that I have detected in your bloodstream. I am going to begin to filter them out.‚Äù
        ‚ÄúUhhh Sofi, AlgoBot, I think - Etherio attack‚Ä¶was - mistake‚Äîhe doesn‚Äôt know where Yieldalgo is‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt feel so good.‚Äù Says Al as he closes his eyes.
        ‚ÄúPassing out is to be expected, but not to worry about. AlgoBot will handle this for now.‚Äù AlgoBot continues to fight Etherio as Sofi figures out a solution.
        ‚ÄúOh Al. Ok Algo Pard, I think our best bet is to head to FutureFi to speak with The Watchers with you and some of your prowl, and Akitalgo. We can track down Yieldalgo with their leads and your noses,‚Äù offers Sofi.
        ‚ÄúI agree. Sometimes I wish Al would wait for us before he does these things, but we are a team, and we have his back,‚Äù chuckles Algo Pard. He continues, ‚ÄúI take it, since we can‚Äôt go in, you‚Äôre gonna do what the magical Sofi does?‚Äù
        Sofi laughs, ‚Äúyes, exactly that. AlgoBot, you can take Al to Doc at The Upgrade Chamber.‚Äù As AlgoBot follows her orders, she teleports to Etherio, and with one touch she sends a short-lived, centralized virus that allows her to control Etherio. She sends a digital code into him that causes him to suck up all the gas he expelled and return to his Gas Tower.
        . . .
        Atop FutureFi, Sofi, Algo Pard, and Akitalgo teleport into a meeting with The Watchers, and to their surprise, Keli is already there with the rest of the prowl and Headline News. ‚ÄúHappy to see us here. We just received a call with some intel on Yieldalgo from Carbora,‚Äù says Algolius.
        ‚ÄúThe Carbora?‚Äù Asks a representative from Headline News. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt she affiliated with Etherio?‚Äù
        ‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs me.‚Äù Replies Carbora.
        ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm pretty popular, but that doesn't mean I don‚Äôt have time for trivial matters. While studying Etherio‚Äôs protocol‚Äôs, I came up with my own Algorithm. So, I do NOT associate with him anymore, ok? I‚Äôm operating on a higher frequency now that I have moved on and made a n‚Äî‚Äù Carbora is cut off.
        ‚ÄúCan you just tell us what you know about Yieldalgo,‚Äù demands Keli.
        ‚ÄúOuuu a feisty one, aren‚Äôt you? Ok I‚Äôll get right to it. Recently whispers across the Carboraverse and at O. Sea Base began to involve this flamingo looking guy that talked a good game and always knew where to get the best gas.‚Äù
        ‚ÄúBest Gas?‚Äù Asks the Headline Rep.
        ‚ÄúYeah Etherio‚Äôs crew gives out some of his ‚Äògas,‚Äô and this flamingo guy was saying that he was doing research‚Ä¶.but I don‚Äôt think anyone needs to run that many tests on his gas. But in short, I think he may be at the abandoned warehouse a few blocks from Bithero‚Äôs old hide out spot,‚Äù she sighs. She continues to say, ‚ÄúI have done my good deed for the day, tootles.‚Äù Carbora ends the video call.
        ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always the popular ones that seem to lack substance,‚Äù scoffs Keli.
        ‚ÄúThis is gold Keli! It gives us a tangible lead of Etherio‚Äôs activities. Let‚Äôs put together a plan to expose AHDL News. I can‚Äôt wait until the public discovers this.‚Äù
        ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do it,‚Äù responds Keli.
        ‚ÄúAll that is true, but this is unfortunate regarding Yieldalgo,‚Äù sighs Algolius.
        ‚ÄúSofi and I will go get him and bring him to the Doc,‚Äù says Algo Pard. Algo Pard picks up Sofi so that she can teleport them.
        ‚ÄúYou do know you do not have to pick me up every time we teleport.‚Äù Says Sofi.
        ‚ÄúOh I know,‚Äù he laughs, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm always going to if I‚Äôm around.‚Äù They both laugh as they go to rescue Yieldalgo.
        . . .
        Our heroes are in the middle of their meeting, and Keli has just asked about Block 0. Yieldalgo goes to raise his hand. ‚ÄúNo. Yieldalgo we love you and respect you, but your incident was fairly recent, and we are still fostering that trust,‚Äù states Keli. Yieldalgo lowers his hand.
        ‚ÄúBurn! Someone‚Äôs gonna have FOMO,‚Äù teases Tiny.
        Algolius, who has video called in, takes himself off of mute, and says ‚ÄúI have important intel on Block 0.‚Äù
